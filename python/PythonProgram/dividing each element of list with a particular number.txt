for row in incsv:
            item =  row[0:1]
            for each in item:
                k=int(each)
                print(type(k))
                
invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1482390189.85'
if in the list that are coming from row[0:1]  is thee any float value so this error will come.
So for overcome from this problem we have to use float(each) instead of int(each) so it will be fine
