# A Python program to demonstrate need 
# of packing and unpacking
 
# A sample function that takes 4 arguments
# and prints them.
def fun(a, b, c, d):
    print(a, b, c, d)
 
# Driver Code
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 
# This doesn't work
fun(my_list)
Run on IDE
Output :

TypeError: fun() takes exactly 4 arguments (1 given)
so for error solving we can use * to unpack the list all elements of it can be passed as different arguments.

#so for this #we have to unpack like this
fun(*my_list)
so the output like o/p--(1,2,3,4)
