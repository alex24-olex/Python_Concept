# Python Function to print leaders in array 
# Write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. An element is leader if it is 
# greater than all the elements to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader. 
# For example int the array {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, leaders are 17, 5 and 2

def printLeaders(arr,size):
    # start = i
    end = size-1
    leader_list = []
    while(end>0):
        if (arr[i]>arr[i+1]):
            
        

        
        # if arr[size]>arr[size-1]        

	
	
# Driver function 
arr=[16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 1] 
printLeaders(arr, len(arr))
